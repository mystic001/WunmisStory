  <span>F</span>ew weeks ago, I was feeling like the whole world was going to be mine today!
  <br/>

  I sat elegantly while I was getting the last touch on my face by my make up artist.
    <br/>
  I wasn’t feeling celebrated but rather worried.
    <br/>
  Looking at my friend Tinu dancing, eating and chatting with people, I became so angry and jealous.
    <br/>

 “You idiot! You pushed me into marriage, yet you’re single, free and still slaying.” I said in my mind.
   <br/>

The truth is that, I wasn’t ready to tie the knot. I didn’t even know what triggered me to conclude that I wanted to get married.
  <br/>

If I had the power to let the moment disappear, I wouldn’t hesitate to use it.
  <br/>

Funny enough, I started having the feelings that my husband does not deserve me. Isn’t that weird?
  <br/>

I called my friend Tinu to come to where I sat. She arrived and bent slightly before me.
  <br/>

“Iyawo yawo.” She said excitedly as she tickled me.
  <br/>

I wasn’t feeling her jokes so I just hissed and took her hand off me.
  <br/>

“What happened B?” She looked into my eyes and asked worriedly.
  <br/>

“Would you believe I still saw Bukky’s picture on Yomi’s (my husband to be) phone 3months ago?” I whispered in her ear.
  <br/>
“And so?” She said as she looked at me shockingly.
  <br/>
“You also remember he promised me he’d stop taking alcohol, but he still takes it once in a while and His haircut is not the one I selected for our wedding.” I said unhappily.
  <br/>
“So what are you trying to insinuate.” She said to me angrily.
  <br/>
“Tinu, the truth is that I don’t want to do this, I’m not sure if Yomi truly loves me, Even if he does, I’m scared he might change and start cheating on me,  Or do you think he can be with only me forever? I think I should have waited a bit more to be sure before doing this. Help me I don’t want to do this.” I bursted into tears.
  <br/>
“Haaaa!!!, Make-up spoilt. I paid for it remember!!!” She exclaimed.
      <br/>
She didn’t act concerned about everything I said, she knew I was bringing up flimsy excuses just so I can get discouraged.
  <br/>
Tinu is always supporting Yomi. So at that moment, I regretted complaining to her.
  <br/>
She stood up and wanted to leave.
  <br/>
“Don’t ruin that makeup I paid for I repeat, or else I’ll pick up the microphone and tell everyone you said you don’t want to get married again.” She said.
  <br/>
I was a bit shocked, but I wish she could do that and let everything just end at that spot. But how do I face Yomi, my family and my friends who love and care about me?
  <br/>
She turned back and whispered in my ear,
“If you fuck this up, I’m going to make Yomi marry Bimpe and I’ll sponsor their marriage”.
  <br/>
This time, I stood up and almost hit her. Bimpe has always been my rival with Yomi since a long time ago. But I’m glad he belongs to me now.
<br/>
“Yomi is my husband remember!” I yelled.
  <br/>
“Indecision!” She said sharply, hissed and left.
<br/>
I was about to get walked down the aisle by my Dad, I dare not tell him my mind so I cooperated.
<br/>
He hugged me and grabbed my left hand, He began to walk me down the aisle. I felt I was about to get forced to do what I didn’t want to do.
<br/>
I saw Yomi sitting, waiting for me to fill my empty seat beside him. He was the most attractive person I was seeing at the event, in fact he appeared like someone I was just meeting for the first time.
<br/>
I’m actually happy to have him and I’ve always believed his love for me but today, I wasn’t certain.
</br/>
I was able to grab his hand and all my negative thoughts died, I became happy and I finally felt like the whole world has become mine.
</br/>
The knot was tied, I smiled with no regret. Tinu winked at me and we both laughed.
</br/>
It was the “Kiss your bride” time.
We held each other tightly, he tasted so sweet and different hmm.
</br/>
Everyone were clapping and shouting as we refused to leave each other.
</br/>
Suddenly, I received a dirty slap on my face as my sister screamed. I’ve plugged my teeth in her shoulder for about 5mins and she has been screaming for help because she couldn’t get me to leave her.
</br/>
I woke up to realize it was all a dream.
</br/>
My sister told me I’ve been walking and running round the room since 2am, and she had been laughing before I suddenly plugged my teeth in her shoulder.
</br/>
But I was so happy that I wasn’t truly getting married because next tomorrow is Monday, and I’ve not even finished school.<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
</br/>
But I’m with an artist right now, trying to sketch out what Yomi looks like so I can hold it when finally looking for husband.
